# College Connect: Workshops Hub

### A comprehensive hub for students seeking to improve their skills by finding and registering for various workshops, hackathons, and technical events held at different colleges.

## About the Project

This web application provides a centralized platform for college students to discover and register for technical events, workshops, and hackathons. It aims to bridge the gap between students and event organizers by providing all necessary details—such as dates, contact information, and registration fees—in one accessible location.

The application features a simple, clean design with easy navigation, allowing users to quickly find the events they are interested in and register directly via provided links.

## Key Features

* **Event Categories:** Separate pages for workshops, hackathons, and general technical events.
* **Detailed Event Information:** Each event tile displays key information, including event title, dates, contact details, and registration fees.
* **Direct Registration Links:** Buttons to easily redirect users to the respective event registration pages.
* **Simple and Intuitive UI:** The website is designed with a straightforward layout for a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the web pages.
